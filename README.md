# clj-picasso

## Overview

This is a simple image processing library for Clojure, developed as a university project. 
The library provides basic functionalities for loading, saving, and manipulating images. 
It is designed to be easy to use and extendable.

## Features

### Image Loading and Saving

- **load-from-path:** Load an image from a file path.
- **load-from-file:** Load an image from a file.
- **save-image:** Save an image to a file.

### Basic Operations

- **resize:** Change the size of an image.
- **scale:** Scale the size of an image.
- **crop:** Crop a region from an image.
- **rotate:** Rotate an image by a specified angle.
- **mirror:** Create an mirror image.

### Filters

- **apply-grayscale:** Apply a grayscale filter to the image.
- **apply-sepia:** Apply a sepia filter to the image.
- **apply-negative:** Apply a negative filter to the image.
- **apply-one-channel:** Convert an image to one channel.
- **apply-median:** Apply a median filter to the image.
- **apply-blur:** Apply a (box) blur filter to the image.
- **adjust-brightness:** Adjust the brightness of the image.
- **adjust-contrast:** Adjust the contrast of the image.

### Image Overlay

- **overlay-images:** Overlay two images with adjustable transparency.

### Drawing on Images

- **draw-line:** Draw line on an image.
- **draw-rectangle:** Draw rectangle on an image.
- **draw-ellipse:** Draw ellipse on an image.

### Watermark

- **set-watermark-text** Add a text watermark to the image.
- **set-watermark-image** Add an image watermark to the image.

### Comparison

- **equal-images?:** Compare two images pixel by pixel.
- **mean-squared-error:** Calculate the mean squared error between two images.

### Batch Processing

- **process-images-in-directory:** Apply a set of operations to all images in a directory.

## Supported Image Formats

**clj-picasso** is built on top of Java's BufferedImage class and supports a variety of image formats. 
The supported image formats include, but may not be limited to:

- JPEG
- PNG
- GIF
- TIFF
- BMP
- WBMP

Please note that the exact set of supported formats can depend on the underlying Java implementation and 
the platform your code is running on. For detailed information about supported image formats in Java, 
refer to the [Java Image I/O API documentation](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/17/docs/api/java.desktop/javax/imageio/package-summary.html).


## Getting Started

To use **clj-picasso** library in your Clojure project, follow the steps below:

### Prerequisites

- [Clojure](https://clojure.org/releases/downloads) installed (version 1.11.1)
- [Leiningen](https://leiningen.org/) build tool for Clojure projects

## Installation

Add the following dependency to your project.clj file:

```clojure
;; [clj-picasso "1.0.0"]
```

## Example usage

```
(require '[clj-picasso.core :as picasso])

;; Load an image
(def image (picasso/load-from-path "path/to/image.jpg"))

;; Apply grayscale filter
(def resized-image (picasso/apply-grayscale image))

;; Save the grayscaled image
(picasso/save-image resized-image "path/to/grayscale-image.jpg")
```

## Testing

[Midje](https://github.com/marick/Midje) was utilized for testing this library.
Midje is a testing library for Clojure that provides a readable and flexible syntax for writing tests.

### Running Tests

To run the tests, ensure that Midje is installed, and then execute the following command:

```bash
lein midje
```
